"""Federated learning workflow.

This submodule implements a *Federated Learning* (FL) workflow.

At a high level, FL is a paradigm for performing deep learning on
decentralized data hosted on decentralized devices (e.g.,
Internet-of-Things devices). Each of these devices separately train their
own copy of a shared model architecture. Their locally-trained copies are
aggregated over time to update a global model which has essentially been
able to learn over all the data in the system without directly accessing
any data.

For more information on FL as a whole, please refer to the following
[paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/mcmahan17a/mcmahan17a.pdf).

This **FedLearn** workflow simulates FL with simple deep neural networks
mnd select set of baseline datasets.

## Example

```bash
python -m webs.run fedlearn --executor process-pool --data-name mnist --data-root data/ --data-download true --num-rounds 1 --participation 0.5
```
